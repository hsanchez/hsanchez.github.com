title: Hello World!
---

This is the first post on huascarsanchez.com - my new website. I decided recently that what could be better than the traditional "Hello World!" to open my new website. Then, there you have it ... 

{% highlight ruby %}
  #!/usr/bin/ruby

  # Hello world ruby program

  puts "Hello World!";  
{% endhighlight %}

Note: My website's theme is not fixed. I am currently working on a new one, which I hope it will ready at the end of this month.
