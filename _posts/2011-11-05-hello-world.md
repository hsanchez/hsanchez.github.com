title: Hello World!
---

Here is the first post on huascarsanchez.com - my new website. My first blog post is the famous Hello World! message. Tell me, what's better than then famous Hello World! message to introduce a new blog? ;-)

{% highlight ruby %}
  #!/usr/bin/ruby

  # Hello world ruby program

  puts "Hello World!";  
{% endhighlight %}

**Note:** As of now, I am still working on a new theme for my website. I am hoping that I will have it ready at the end of this month.
