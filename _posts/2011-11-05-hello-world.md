title: Hello World!
---

This is the first post on huascarsanchez.com - my new website. Recently, I decided that it would be a good idea to open my new website with the traditional "Hello World!" message. Then, there you have it ... The famous "Hello World!" 

{% highlight ruby %}
  #!/usr/bin/ruby

  # Hello world ruby program

  puts "Hello World!";  
{% endhighlight %}

Note: As of now, I am still working on a new theme for my website. I am hoping that I will have it ready at the end of this month.
