title: My Twitter Bullying Detection Project
---

According to Google Analytics and to other sources, my data mining project titled ``Twitter Bullying Detection'' is getting some
attention. An earlier version of the project report was hosted on the co-author of the project's [website](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~shreyask/index.html). This version is good in terms of communicating the project's main idea and motivation. However, I think it is always important to have the latest version available. Therefore, I decided to post this latest version [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11902217/huascarsanchez_and_shreyaskumar-twitterbullyingdection-fnl.pdf).

Also, for the sake of convenience, I decided to post the report's abstract too:

> # Abstract
> Bullying is major public health problem in the Western World. It has become more than just a physical assault; bullies now 
> assault and/or verbally abuse their victims over the Internet via a variety of means, such as text messaging, chat rooms, 
> etc. This form of aggressive behavior over the Internet is known as “Cyber-bullying.” Since this is an increasing public 
> concern, for our project, we are interested in both understanding bullying in social networks and exploring ways to 
> efficiently detect it. The main contribution of this paper is the idea of using sentiment analysis to detect bullying. To 
> the best of our knowledge, there isn’t any previous work on using sentiment analysis to detect bullying. Our training dataset
> consists of Twitter messages (a.k.a., tweets) containing commonly used terms of abuse (e.g., ‘Dike’). These terms are considered 
> noisy labels in our approach. We use the Naïve Bayes classifier for the classification of tweets. We experiment with our bullying 
> detection technique on Twitter's service due to its popularity. 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the content of that report. Thanks.
