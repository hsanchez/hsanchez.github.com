I am a a Postdoctoral fellow at [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/). As a Postdoc, I collaboratively investigate how to build scalable automated mechanisms to identify and repair program errors, and specification-based tools to create and synthesize new, custom programs based on collected knowledge gained through larget code repository mining. 

As indicated in the [welcome](http://huascarsanchez.com) page, my research background is in programmer productivity, human-computer interaction, and information retrieval issues in software engineering. I am interested in developing tools that can help programmers overcome their daily programming and code foraging barriers in order to make them more productive.    

I have a MS in software engineering from [San Jose State University](http://www.sjsu.edu/). The focus of my research at San Jose State was in domain analysis and pattern languages.
