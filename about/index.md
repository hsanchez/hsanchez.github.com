I am a Computer Scientist in the Computer Science Lab (CSL) at [SRI
International](https://www.sri.com/). My research, at SRI, combines large scale
program repository mining with foundational ideas underlying data curation and
program analysis in order to create hybrid human-computer systems.

At [CSL](http://www.csl.sri.com/), I work on leveraging big data analytics
applied to code to develop radically different approaches for automatically
constructing, verifying, and explaining complex programs. My research blends
numerous CS subfields from software engineering, to source code curation, to
"big code" analytics.

At [UC Santa Cruz](http://www.ucsc.edu/), the focus of my research was on making
code foraging less informal and more thoughtful. This research introduced the
notion of <a href="/posts/thesiswork">Source Code Curation</a>, as well as the
tools that implements it. Source Code Curation is a blend of three activities:
filtering, refinement, and validation. Source Code Curationâ€™s goal is to improve
the quality of online source code before reuse, validate its fitness for use,
and assist with code understanding.

At [San Jose State University](http://www.sjsu.edu/), the focus of my research
was on domain analysis and pattern languages. I investigated how to build
software systems as a system of patterns, known as [Knowledge
Maps](http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781466571433).
