I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz](http://cs.soe.ucsc.edu/). My research interest include software engineering, specifically source code curation; an approach to discovering, cleaning, and refining online code snippets upon which to build programs. 

The goal of my research is to ensure code snippets one finds on the Web are fit for one's purpose and trustworthy. To achieve this, I study the above area with the aim of inventing technologies that help code foragers to clean, annotate, and refine (i.e., curate) pieces of source code found on the Web. 

My hypothesis is basically that source code curation can improve the understanding, credibility, trust, and reusability of code snippets that pass through a curation process.

I have a MS in software engineering from [San Jose State University](http://www.sjsu.edu/). The focus of my research at San Jose State was on domain analysis and pattern languages.
