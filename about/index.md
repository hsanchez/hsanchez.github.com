title: About
---

I am a a Postdoctoral fellow at [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/). As a Postdoc, I collaboratively investigate how to build scalable automated mechanisms to identify and repair program errors, and specification-based tools to create and synthesize new, custom programs based on collected knowledge gained through large code repository mining. 

As indicated in the <a href="/">welcome</a> page, my research focuses on addressing programmer productivity, human-computer interaction, and information retrieval issues in software engineering. I am interested in developing tools that can help programmers not only overcome their daily programming and code foraging barriers, but also boost their productivity. 

At [UC Santa Cruz](http://www.ucsc.edu/), the focus of my research was on making code foraging less informal and more thoughtful. This research introduced the notion of <a href="/posts/thesiswork">Source Code Curation</a>. Source Code Curation is a blend of three activities: filtering, refinement, and validation. Source Code Curationâ€™s goal is to improve the quality of online source code before reuse, validate its fitness for use, and assist with code understanding.

At [San Jose State University](http://www.sjsu.edu/), the focus of my research was on domain analysis and pattern languages. I investigated how to build adaptable software systems using the notion of [Knowledge Maps](http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781466571433).
