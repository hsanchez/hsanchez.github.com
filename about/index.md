I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz](http://cs.soe.ucsc.edu/).
My research interest include software engineering, specifically **source code curation**.

As indicated in the [welcome](http://huascarsanchez.com) page, the goal of my research is to ensure
source code one finds on the Web is fit for one's purpose and trustworthy. To achieve this, I study
the above area with the aim of inventing technologies that help code foragers to clean, annotate,
and refine (i.e., **curate**) pieces of source code found on the Web.

I have a MS in software engineering from [San Jose State University](http://www.sjsu.edu/). The
focus of my research at San Jose State was on domain analysis and pattern languages.
