I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz](http://cs.soe.ucsc.edu/).

As indicated in the [welcome](http://huascarsanchez.com) page, the goal of my research is to develop tools around code foraging. These tools would address best practices in the following areas:  

1. Curating source code: [Curating a source code](#) of interest to make sure it is fit for one's purpose and trustworthy. What are the best techniques for curating source code?

2. Searching the curated collection of source code: This is the area where a set of documented techniques could shine. How can we help programmers search curated source code better with fewer clicks?

3. Synthesizing solutions from the contributions of the many: What tools or approaches can programmers use to craft solutions from the contributions of the many (e.g., curated source code collections)? 

A description of such areas suggests a process of open exploration. Programmers can engage in this alone and together with others. By actively investing themselves in such a process, they can intuitively experiment with ideas hands-on and thus unlocking know-how, leading to more confidence in the source code found before their consumption in a development environment (e.g., editors).

I have a MS in software engineering from [San Jose State University](http://www.sjsu.edu/). The
focus of my research at San Jose State was in domain analysis and pattern languages.
