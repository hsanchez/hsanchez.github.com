## The Vesper, {{page.description}}

The **Vesper** is a code transformation library. It's designed and developed with one 
purpose: to provide an API for transforming and scouring online Java code snippets.

As of now, its source code is still private. I plan to release it (under the MIT license) 
sometime in September 2014. Here is its [link](https://github.com/hsanchez/vesper) on Github.
 
Here are the tools that were made with the Vesper: 

1. [Kiwi](https://github.com/hsanchez/vesper-http) (Private) and 
2. [Violette](https://github.com/hsanchez/vesper-web) (Private) 

Please send me an email if you want to know more about the Vesper and its flavors (Kiwi and Violette). 
Thanks.
