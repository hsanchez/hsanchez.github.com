## Code Multistager, {{page.description}}

The idea behind Multistaging to Understand (MTU) is that given a series of code stages (extracted from a code example), programmers non-sequentially inspect a few of these stages, mentally abstract their functionality, and then use that knowledge to understand the example's intended function. The following slides walks the reader through what MTU is and what's behind it:
