## Violette, {{page.description}}

**Violette** is the companion Chrome extension to Vesper.

When installed, Violette detects Java code blocks on StackOverflow and then transform
them into a form that allows developers to edit and change the code in-place (in the web page of the Q&A system).

This in-place editing is done via a combination of manual edits or a few semi automated code transformations/refactorings
built in the vesperin system.

Out of the box, Violette supports the following operations.

1. Programming language detection using heuristics.
2. Code transformations and refactorings.  
3. Content annotation via notes.
4. Syntax correctness validation.
5. Preview mode.



## Additional information

All the curated code snippets will be available, as tweets, on Twitter. If you want to see them, please follow [@codedetour](https://twitter.com/codedetour).
