## Violette, {{page.description}}


**Violette** is intended to extend the Chrome Web browser with source code curation capabilities. It is one the main companions of the **Vesper** library. This tool allows code foragers to curate Java code snippets found on Stackoverflow.

Here are some of the UI components you may expect to see when activating Violette on Stackoverflow:

### Toolbar

The following image shows Violette's toolbar. Each button on this toolbar represents an operation the User can perform when curating a code snippet.

* `Delete`: Safely delete a class, method, field, parameter, etc. if no occurrences of it are found in the solution.
* `Cleanup`: Full Cleanup complements code reformatting with additional actions. Specifically, deduplication, and unused imports removal.
* `Clip`: Clip part or all of any code snippet that interest you. As of now, one can only clip a single method, or multiple methods within a class.
* `Rename`: Helps change names of classes, methods, fields, local variables and other symbols.
* `Comment`: Add valuable information to any part or all of the code snippet. They give meaningful feedback to those who edit code.
* `Fullscreen`: Edit code in fullscreen mode.
* `Question mark`: Displays Violette's help.


### Footer

The following image shows Violette's footer. The first two buttons will show up only when the found code snippet lacks of a Class wrapping a method or a sequence of Java statements or when the found code snippet contains syntax errors. The rest of the components will be available when the code is being edited.

* `Plus`: Creates a class, which it will wrap a method (s) or a sequence of Java statements.
* `Steps`: It skips any help from Violette and allows the user to step in and start editing. **Protip**: If you use this mode, please make sure the verify action is the next action you perform.
* `Slider`: It keeps a history of your edits (READ ONLY).  
* `Verify`: Verifies if the code is syntactically correct (i.e., no errors were found on the code)
* `Preview`: It previews your curated code.

### Not visible

* `Ctrl-F / Cmd-F`: Start searching for symbols.
* `Ctrl-G / Cmd-G`: Move to next found match.
* `Shift-Ctrl-G / Shift-Cmd-G`: Move to previous found match.
* `Shift-Ctrl-F / Cmd-Option-F`: Start replacing matches.
* `Shift-Ctrl-R / Shift-Cmd-Option-F`: Start replacing ALL matches.


## Experiment

To evaluate **Violette**, I have put together the following **experiment**:

You, the subject, will be asked to pick, from a list of *randomly selected* code snippets generated by this site, at least two code snippets to curate. Then, after curating the code snippets, you will be asked to complete a survey.

Today's theme is *Sorting algorithms*. That is, for today's experiment this site will download the top answers  from [Stackoverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) for the tags "java" and "sort". Then, it will randomly select 5 top answers from the list of valid answers. These 5 answers are the source code curation candidates.


## Before starting the task (Pressing the START button)

1. Make sure you have Google Chrome (**Version >= 36.0**) installed on your computer.
2. Download [Violette](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dpse9g1nojt4e73/vesper-web.crx).  
3. Install it on Google Chrome.


## The Task

Your task is to **curate**—correct, improve, and extend—at least two code snippets from the 5 answer list. Your goal is to try to make the found code snippets as reusable and complete as possible. Cases
that are beyond repair can be skipped, so that you can pick another code snippet candidate.

If you meet the above prerequisites, then press the **START** button to get your first batch of code snippets to curate.

<div class="sorter">
    <button id="sort">START</button>
</div>

<div id="columns">
    <div id="left-col">
        <h4><strong>Searching for candidates</strong></h4>
        <div id="logger"></div>
        <div id="stopper" class="hide">
           Had enough? <a href="#" id="stop">Stop it!</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="right-col">
    <h4><strong>Found candidates</strong></h4>
    <div id="displayer"></div>
</div>
<div id="clear"></div>


Thank you for trying **Violette**. Now, we need your feedback. Please take a few minutes
to complete our [survey](http://goo.gl/vzqmzG).


## Additional information

All the curated code snippets will be available, as tweets, on Twitter. If you want to see them, please follow [@codedetour](https://twitter.com/codedetour).
