## Violette, {{page.description}}

**Violette** is the companion Chrome extension to Vesper. When installed, Violette detects Java code blocks on StackOverflow and then transform them into a form that allows developers to actually edit and change the code in-place, in the web page of the Q&A system.

Out of the box, Violette supports the following operations.

1. Programming language detection.  
2. Code transformations and refactorings.  
3. Content annotation via notes.
4. Syntax correctness validation.
5. Preview mode.



## Additional information

All the curated code snippets will be available, as tweets, on Twitter. If you want to see them, please follow [@codedetour](https://twitter.com/codedetour).
