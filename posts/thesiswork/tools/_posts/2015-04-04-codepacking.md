## Codepacking, {{page.description}}

Codepacking is a technique for automatically resolving missing enclosing body 
declarations and missing dependencies. It's goal is to approximate the 
declarative completeness of partial programs. 

Codepacking's code is still private. However, once it becomes public, it 
will be available <a href="http://bit.ly/1K9CeoY" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you want to get access to this code, please send me an [email]
