## Codepacking

_Codepacking_ is a technique for automatically resolving incomplete code snippets. Its ultimate goal is not about achieving program correctness but approximating program completeness. _Codepacking_ produces an Abstract Syntax Tree (_AST_) of a partial program that _Vesperin_ can manipulate. 

_Codepacking_ consists of four steps:

1. Surrounds code example with the appropriate body declarations (class, method, or both), if needed. 
2. It cross references missing type information of existing ill-typed expressions with a repository of pre-acquired API information and then suggests their well-typed corrections. 
3. It uses Vesperin's code transformation utilities to add the suggested corrections to the exampleâ€™s code. 
4. It produces the desired AST.


Codepacking's code is still private. However, once it becomes public, it 
will be available <a href="https://github.com/vesperin/" target="_blank">here</a>.
