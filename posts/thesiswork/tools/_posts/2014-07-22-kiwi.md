## Kiwi, {{page.description}}


The Kiwi API was implemented in Scala. It consists of two logical services: Curation and Parsing.

The Curation service manages Vesperinâ€™s curation operations, such as basic code transformations and refactorings, code presentation, and publication (published on Twitter). The Parsing service manages the access to a Java parsing API, built on top of Eclipse JDT[^1].

All requests are, by default, provided as JSON. There is no authentication required to make Curation and Parsing API calls.

Kiwi HTTP layer uses the Spray[^2] framework to build a REST/HTTP-based integration layer. This layer is responsible for serving HTTP requests. It has the following HTTP endpoints as an API:

1. POST /kiwi/eval? {curation command}  
2. PUT /kiwi/eval? {persist code command}  
3. GET /kiwi/find?q={query text}  
4. GET /kiwi/render?id={code id}

Here is an example of a curation command (e.g., Rename method):

{% highlight javascript %}
{"rename": {
  "what": "method",
  "where": [1, 6],
  "source": {
    "name": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "content": "..."
  }
 }
}
{% endhighlight %}
