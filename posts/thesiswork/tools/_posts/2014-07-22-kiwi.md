## Kiwi, {{page.description}}

**Kiwi** is the interface of the Vesper to the world. Its main purpose is to wrap Vesper and turn it 
into a RESTful service. You can access its help page [here](http://www.vesperin.com/kiwi/help).

Kiwi's second responsibility is to render individual HTML pages for any code snippet curated with 
Violette.   

In order to understands what information should be included in the HTML presentation of a curated snippet, 
I have put together a survey in order to gather some data about the best way to present curated code snippets.

[Take Survey](http://goo.gl/vhg140)


All the curated code snippets will be available, as tweets, on Twitter. So, before taking the survey, 
please follow [@codedetour](https://twitter.com/codedetour). After that, you will have access to 
@codedetour's tweets, which are a summary of each curated code snippet.
