In order to understands what information should be included in the presentation of a curated snippet, 
I have put together a survey in order to gather some data about the best way to present curated code snippets.

[Take Survey](http://goo.gl/vhg140)


All the curated code snippets will be available, as tweets, on Twitter. So, before taking the survey, 
please follow [@codedetour](https://twitter.com/codedetour). After that, you will have access to 
@codedetour's tweets, which a summary of each curated code snippet.
