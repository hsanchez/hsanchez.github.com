## Vesper, {{page.description}}


Vesper is built atop Eclipseâ€™s JDT Java Parser and AST/DOM transformation 
utilities. This mechanism allows Vesperin to work with partial and 
non-compiling programs, not just complete ones. 

Vesper's code is still private. However, once it becomes public, it will be 
available <a href="http://bit.ly/1K9CeoY" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you want to get access to this code, please send me an [email](mailto:hsanchez@cs.ucsc.edu).
