The Vesper, {{page.description}}


The purpose of this experiment is to evaluate Vesper.  
 
You, the subject, will be asked to pick, from a list of code snippets generated by this site, at least 
two code snippets to curate. Then, you will be asked to complete a survey.

Today's theme is *Sorting algorithms*. That is, this site will download the top 
answers from [Stackoverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) for the tags "java" and "sort". Then, it 
will randomly select 5 answers from the list of valid answers.

These 5 answers are the source code curation candidates.  
 
## Before starting the task
 
1. Make sure you have Google Chrome installed on your computer.   
1. Download [Violette](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dpse9g1nojt4e73/vesper-web.crx).  
2. Install it on Google Chrome.   

## The Task 

The task is to curate—correct, improve, and extend—at least two code snippets from the 5 answer list. 

## The Means

Press **START** to get your first batch of code snippets
