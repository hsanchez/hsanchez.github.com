description: Evaluating StackOverflow Code examples.

To evaluate how people evaluate code examples on StackOverflow, I have put together the following
**experiment**. Please follow all of the instructions below:


# PREREQS

Make sure you have

1. Google Chrome latest version installed on your computer.
2. Uninstalled any previously installed version of Violette from Chrome.

# THE TASK

There will be 6 Java code examples to review and understand. For each example, there will be
a link to it. This link will take you to a Q&A page containing a StackOverflow's accepted answer.
This answer contains some Java code.

*For each linked Java code example, do the following*

1. You, the participant, must click on a linked code example.
This link will take you to the example's Q&A page at StackOverflow.

    Note: Don't click on the next link if you have not finished reviewing and understanding
    the previous Java code example

2. Once you are on that page, your goal is to review and understand the Java
code example.

    Please record the time spent reviewing the Java code example. Please submit 
    this information as the answer for "How long did you spend reviewing and 
    understanding the Java code example?", which is found in the 
    online [questionnaire](http://bit.ly/1OQoF0D) you will be completing.


4. After you've finished reviewing and understanding the code example, please 
complete the following [questionnaire](http://bit.ly/1OQoF0D).

# TASK EXPECTATIONS

We expect the following throughout the task:

**1.** We expect you to review and understand a total of **6** Java code examples,
provided in this page.

**2.** We expect the whole task be done within **1 hr and 30 minutes**.

**3.** We expect the subjects to use only the resources available on the
question-answer page to complete the task; i.e., no external resources like
Wikipedia.

**4.** You will complete the [questionnaire](http://bit.ly/1OQoF0D) for each reviewed 
code example.
