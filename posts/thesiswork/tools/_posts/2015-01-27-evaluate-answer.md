Please follow all of the instructions below:


# PREREQS

Make sure you have

1. Google Chrome latest version installed on your computer.
2. Uninstalled any previously installed version of Violette from Chrome.

# GUIDELINES FOR THE READ TO UNDERSTAND

## GOAL

Gain understanding in (without multi staging to understand)

* Control flow:   what is the sequence of execution?
* State:          what is the content of a data object?
* Operations:     what does the code compute?
* Data flow:      where does a data object get updated?
* Function:       what is the overall functionality?

## GUIDELINES

1. Spend your time wisely, don't go outside the Q&A page.
2. Gain understanding in the asked abstractions; e.g., control flow, etc.

# THE TASK

There will be 3 Java code examples (Accepted Answers) to review and understand. Use the appointed 
comprehension technique (either Read to Understand or Multi staging to Understand) 
to dig into each of the Java code examples. After 30 minutes, per Java code example, 
you will be asked to answer a number of questions about the reviewed piece of code.

    Please record the time spent reviewing the Java code example. 
    Please submit this information as the answer for "How long did you 
    spend reviewing and understanding the Java code example?", 
    which is found in the online questionnaire you will be 
    completing after finishing the whole task.

For each example, there will be two links. First link will take you to a page 
containing a StackOverflow's accepted answer. This answer contains some Java code. 
Second link will take you to an online questionnaire where you'll answer a number 
of questions about the reviewed piece of code.

After you've finished reviewing and understanding the Java code example, please 
comeback to the experiment page. Then, click on the Java code example's second 
link to answer the questionnaire.

After answering the questionnaire, close its page and then comeback to the experiment 
page. Once there, click on the next Java code example to review.

Lastly, after reviewing all code examples and answering their questionnaires, please answer 
our <a href="http://bit.ly/1KPyrlW" target="_blank">debriefing questionnaire</a>.

# TASK EXPECTATIONS

We expect the following throughout the task:

**1.** We expect you to review and understand a total of **3** Java code examples,
in the **order provided** in this page.

**2.** We expect the whole task be done within **2 hrs**; including the 
the time spent reviewing this page.

**3.** We expect the subjects to use only the resources available on the
question-answer page to complete the task; i.e., no external resources like
Wikipedia should be used.
