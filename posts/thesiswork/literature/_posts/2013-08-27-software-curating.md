Joasia Krysa's thesis is about Software curating; an interdeciplinary approach that merges programming with curating to challenge the role of the curator in.


kurator is an open source software application designed as an online curatorial system and a platform for curating source code that can be further modified by users. The project is experimental in that it merges the process of programming with curating to challenge the role of the curator in the process of selection, contextualisation, presentation ad dissemination of online artworks, by emphasising not the aesthetical or functional properties of art works but the source code itself. The project follows the structures and protocols of traditional curating and implements a system that partly automates these procedures. It translates curatorial protocols into modular software protocols, breaking down the curatorial process into a series of commands or rules. The software aims to extend these in an unpredictable, unprescribed, and uncontrolled manner in addition to the vagaries of the user’s input and any modifications they make. In this way the project recognises recent practice and discussions around ‘software art’ and posits the idea of ‘software curating’. The project speculates upon the production of software beyond a closed proprietary model to a collaborative open source model as a tool for future public development.
