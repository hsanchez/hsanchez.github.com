## The Politics of Curating in/as (an) Open System (s)

Joasia Krysa's [thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/326) is about software curating; an interdeciplinary approach that merges programming with curating to challenge the role of the curator when it comes to selecting, presenting, and spreading online artworks. In her thesis, she examines how information technologies have changed the practice of curating and then suggests a curating model that takes this into account.  This curational model was embedded into an experimental software for curating source code (Kurator). This software partly automates the procedures of traditional curating. Indeed, it tries to follow its structures and protocols.

The thesis was a bit abstract. There were times where key ideas were difficult to follow. However, after a couple of readins, I discovered many valuable insights that could be used in my research.
