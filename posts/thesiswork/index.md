My [**thesis work**]({% post_url 2015-10-25-abstract %}) explores the notion of Source Code Curation in the context of foraging for useful source on the Web to help solve a programming task, and the [**tools**](./tools) that implement this notion. The following slides unpack some of these elements as well as provide some background information before diving into the core work.

_Source Code Curation_ covers the act of discovering a source code snippet of interest, cleaning and transforming it, and then presenting it in a meaningful and organized way. It aims at forging new relationships among activities such as code recommendation, code documentation generation, program understanding, and code retrieval. They all play a role in curation: from recommending the best ranked source code candidates to allowing frequent documentation and code edits to keep source code fresh and relevant.
