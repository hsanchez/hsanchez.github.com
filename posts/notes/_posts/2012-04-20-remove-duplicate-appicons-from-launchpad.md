title: Removing duplicate App icons in Launchpad (OS X 10.6+)
---

If there are multiple icon instances of one application in your Mac's Launchpad,
then here is how to get rid of those duplicate instances:

- Delete, or you simply drag and drop the application from Launchpad to
  the trash. Lion OS will automatically remove all the icons in Launchpad related
  to that App.
- Then, simply drag and drop the App from the trash back to the applications
  folder. You will notice now there is only one icon for that App in your Launchpad.

I am hoping Apple will solve this problem soon.

**Update**

OS X 10.6 or later does not have this problem anymore.
