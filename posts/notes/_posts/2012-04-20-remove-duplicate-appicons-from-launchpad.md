description: Steps to removing them.

If there are multiple icon instances of one application in your Mac's Launchpad, 
then here is how to get rid of those duplicate instances:

- Delete, or you simply drag and drop the application from Launchpad to 
  the trash. Lion OS will automatically remove all the icons in Launchpad related 
  to that App.
- Then, simply drag and drop the App from the trash back to the applications 
  folder. You will notice now there is only one icon for that App in your Launchpad.

I am hoping Apple will solve this problem soon.
