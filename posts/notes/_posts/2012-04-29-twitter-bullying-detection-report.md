title: Cyberbullying detection in social networks
---

According to Google Analytics and to other sources, my data mining (ISM 245 class) project titled "Twitter Bullying Detection" is getting some attention. An earlier version of the project report was hosted on the co-author of the project's [website](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~shreyask/index.html). This version
is good in terms of communicating the project's main idea and motivation. However, I think it is always important to have the latest version available. Therefore, I decided to post this latest version [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11902217/huascarsanchez_and_shreyaskumar-twitterbullyingdection-fnl.pdf).

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the content of
that report. Thanks.
