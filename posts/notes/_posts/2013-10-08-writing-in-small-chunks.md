title: Writing smalls chunks of text in small chunks of time
---

I have a hard time sitting still and on track. I get easily derailed by many things, such as social media, news, a wandering mind, worries, etc. 

Consequently, I've tailored my writing routine around this restlessness. 

I live by my [timers](http://handsmemory.com), writing in chunks until time is up. Then I take a few breaks. I used these time periods to quell any distractions. 

I give myself 30 minutes to write. 

I follow the [chunking method](http://bit.ly/15wpZ7). This method makes reading and understanding faster and easier.   

I do my best to maintain this routine since it improves my focus and concentration.

It also helps me convey information more efficiently. I don't get burned out. And there is no chance for social media to derail me.  

I also apply this method when programming; e.g. writing small chunks of functionality in small chunks of time.
