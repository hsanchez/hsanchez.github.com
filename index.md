Hi, I'm **Huascar** (pronounced wäs-kär), a Computer Scientist in the [Computer
Science Laboratory](http://www.csl.sri.com/) at [SRI
International](https://www.sri.com/). Before joining SRI, I was a member of the
[Software Introspection Lab](https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/sil) at [UC Santa
Cruz](http://www.ucsc.edu/), working with [Jim
Whitehead](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~ejw/).

I received my PhD in Computer Science from [UC Santa Cruz](http://www.ucsc.edu/)
in December 2015, and my MS in Software Engineering from [San Jose State
University](http://www.sjsu.edu/) in 2006. Much of my current research is on the
interface between open source software development and foundational ideas
underlying program analysis, and how the computational solutions that emerge in
this space can be used to construct reliable, robust, and efficient software
systems. 
<!-- My primary research area is applied
software engineering, with a particular focus on programmer productivity,
information retrieval, and human-computer interaction. -->

My [**<span>Erd&ouml;s</span>**](http://wwwp.oakland.edu/enp/) number is **3**:
P. Schweitzer, B.D. McKay, and P. Erd&ouml;s.


Cheers,  
Huascar A. Sanchez
