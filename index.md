Hi, I'm **Huascar** (pronounced wäs-kär), a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz](http://cs.soe.ucsc.edu/), working with [Jim Whitehead](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~ejw/) at the Software Introspection Lab.

My research interests include software engineering, specifically **source code curation**;  a practice that is partially automated, dynamic, and often undertaken by code foragers. Much like source code searching, source code curation involves discovering a piece of source code of interest on the Internet. However, source code curation also involves annotating, cleaning and refining this piece of source code as code foragers try to make sense of it&mdash;while still browsing the Web. 

A description such as **source code curation** suggests a process of open exploration. Code foragers can engage in this alone and together with others. By actively investing themselves in curating source code, they can intuitively experiment with ideas hands-on and thus unlocking know-how, leading to more confidence in the source code found before consumption in the IDEs or editors.

Basically, I hypothesize that source code curation can improve the understanding, the confidence, and most importantly the reusability of [otherwise hard to reuse] source code that pass through a curation process.

If you want to get in touch, send an [email](mailto:hsanchez@cs.ucsc.edu).

Cheers,
