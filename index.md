Hi, I'm **Huascar** (pronounced wäs-kär), a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz](http://cs.soe.ucsc.edu/), working with [Jim Whitehead](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~ejw/). My research interest include software engineering, specifically **source code curation**; an approach to discovering, cleaning, and refining online code snippets upon which to build programs. 


Cheers,  
Huascar A. Sanchez
