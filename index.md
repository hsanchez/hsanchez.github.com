Hi, I'm **Huascar** (pronounced wäs-kär), a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz](http://cs.soe.ucsc.edu/), working with [Jim Whitehead](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~ejw/) at the Software Introspection Lab.

My research interests include software engineering, specifically **source code curation**; a practice that is partially automated, dynamic, and collaborative. Much like data curation, source code curation addresses the challenge of discovering a source code of interest, cleaning and refining it (i.e., maintaining it) in a manner that not only preserves its meaning and usefulness, but also improves its credibility and trustworthiness.

A description such as **source code curation** suggests a process of open exploration. Code foragers can engage in this alone and together with others. By actively investing themselves in curating source code, they can intuitively experiment with ideas hands-on and thus unlocking know-how, leading to more confidence in the source code found before consumption in the IDEs or editors.

Basically, I hypothesize that source code curation can improve the understanding, credibility, trust, and most importantly the reusability of [otherwise hard to reuse] source code that pass through a curation process.

If you want to get in touch, send an [email](mailto:hsanchez@cs.ucsc.edu).

Cheers,
Huascar A. Sanchez
